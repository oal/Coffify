Grunt / CoffeeScript base
=========================

This is a small base project set up with Grunt / CoffeeScript and Browserify.

It will watch all `.coffee` files in `src/` recursively, and build the project when files change. Browserify starts from main.js, but you can change that in `Gruntfile.coffee`
